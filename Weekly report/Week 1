The Placement Activities Management System Module 1 (Student Portfolio) aims to streamline the process of managing and showcasing student profiles for placement activities. 
This module focuses on enabling students to create, update, and maintain comprehensive portfolios that include personal details, academic achievements, certifications, skills, projects, internships, and extracurricular activities. 
The system will allow administrators and placement coordinators to access and verify student profiles efficiently, ensuring accuracy and consistency in data. 
The objective is to provide a centralized and user-friendly platform that enhances students' visibility to recruiters, supports data-driven placement decisions, and optimizes the overall placement process for institutions.
